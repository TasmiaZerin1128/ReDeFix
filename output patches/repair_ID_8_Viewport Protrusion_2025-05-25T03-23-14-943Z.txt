To resolve the "Viewport Protrusion" failure, we need to address the localized properties that are causing the issue. Specifically, we need to adjust the `font-size` of the `h1` element and ensure the `body` width does not exceed the viewport size.

Here is the repair patch:

```css
/* Adjust the font-size of the h1 element */
HTML BODY HEADER DIV DIV H1 {
    font-size: 50px; /* Adjust this value as needed to fit within the viewport */
}

/* Ensure the body width does not exceed the viewport size */
HTML BODY {
    width: 100vw; /* Set the width to 100% of the viewport width */
    overflow-x: hidden; /* Hide any overflow content */
}
```

This patch should resolve the viewport protrusion issue by ensuring that the `h1` element's font size is within the viewport boundaries and that the body width does not exceed the viewport size.
