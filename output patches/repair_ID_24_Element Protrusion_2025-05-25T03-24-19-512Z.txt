To resolve the Element Protrusion failure, we need to address the localized properties that are causing the issue. The properties that need fixing are:

1. `width: 210px` for the element `/HTML/BODY/DIV/DIV[2]/DIV/DIV/FORM/DIV/INPUT`
2. `width: 50.9219px` for the element `/HTML/BODY/DIV/DIV[2]/DIV/DIV/FORM/DIV/INPUT[2]`
3. `font-size: 14px` for the element `/HTML/BODY/DIV/DIV[2]/DIV/DIV/FORM/DIV/INPUT`
4. `font-size: 14px` for the element `/HTML/BODY/DIV/DIV[2]/DIV/DIV/FORM/DIV/INPUT[2]`

We will adjust these properties to ensure that the elements fit within their container without protruding. Here is the repair patch:

```css
/* Adjust the width of the input elements to ensure they fit within their container */
HTML BODY DIV DIV[2] DIV DIV FORM DIV INPUT {
    width: 100%; /* Adjust to fit within the container */
}

HTML BODY DIV DIV[2] DIV DIV FORM DIV INPUT[2] {
    width: 100%; /* Adjust to fit within the container */
}

/* Adjust the font-size to ensure the elements fit within their container */
HTML BODY DIV DIV[2] DIV DIV FORM DIV INPUT {
    font-size: 12px; /* Adjust to fit within the container */
}

HTML BODY DIV DIV[2] DIV DIV FORM DIV INPUT[2] {
    font-size: 12px; /* Adjust to fit within the container */
}
```

This patch ensures that the input elements and their font sizes are adjusted to fit within their container, resolving the Element Protrusion failure.
