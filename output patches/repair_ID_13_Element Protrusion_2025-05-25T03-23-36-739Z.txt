To address the element protrusion issue, we need to modify the CSS properties of the failing elements. The localized properties causing the failure are:

1. `width: 109px` for the element `/HTML/BODY/DIV[5]/DIV[2]/DIV/DIV/A`
2. `font-size: 4rem` for the element `/HTML/BODY/DIV[5]/DIV[2]/DIV/DIV/A`

We will adjust these properties to ensure the element fits within its container, especially within the viewport range of 320-357 pixels.

Here is the repair patch:

```css
/* Adjust the width and font-size for the failing element */
/* Adjust the width of the element to fit within the container */
/* Adjust the font-size to ensure it does not protrude */
@media screen and (max-width: 357px) {
    /HTML/BODY/DIV[5]/DIV[2]/DIV/DIV/A {
        width: auto; /* Allow the width to adjust automatically */
        font-size: 1rem; /* Reduce the font-size to fit within the container */
    }
}
```

This CSS rule ensures that the element's width and font-size are adjusted for smaller viewports, preventing it from protruding outside its container. The `width: auto` allows the element to adjust its width based on its content, and the `font-size: 1rem` ensures the text fits within the container without causing an overflow.
